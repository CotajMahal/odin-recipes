    <li>There are three basic kinds of rice: short-grain, long-grain, and medium-grain. Among them you'll find hundreds of different varieties.</li>

    <li><strong>Short-grain rice</strong> is rounded and plump, with a high starch content that makes the grains stick together when cooked, especially if the rice has been milled to make white rice.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Long-grain</strong> rice is much longer than it is wide. Its lower starch content makes the cooked grains lighter, dryer, and more easily separated.</li>
    
    <li><strong><Medium-grain</strong> rice slots right between short- and long-grain rice both in shape and starchiness.</li>
    
    </ul>

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

<ol start with="1">
<li>To cook long-grained white rice on the stove, use a 2 to 1 water to rice ratio. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. You can add an optional pinch of salt if you wish. Add 1 cup of rice, stir briefly to break up clumps of rice, cover the pot with the lid, and reduce the heat to its lowest setting to help the rice cook evenly. If the temperature is too high, the bottom of the pan of rice can scorch while the rice at the top is still undercooked.

    </li>
    
    <li>Set a timer for 20 minutes. A little steam will escape the covered pot while the rice cooksâ€“this is normal. Resist the temptation to lift the lid and peek before the timer runs out, otherwise too much moisture will escape and your rice will be too dry.</li>
   
    <li>When the timer rings, turn off the burner and remove the pan from the heat. Let the rice sit, covered, for an additional five minutes. No peeking! Let the steam finish doing its work to plump and cook the rice.</li>
    
    <li>After five minutes, remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains.

        <ul><li>You can serve the rice immediately, or put the lid back on to keep it warm while you finish cooking the rest of your meal.</li>
        
        <li>To chill rice for a salad, spread it out on a sheet pan to cool quickly.</li>
        
        <li>For food safety reasons, rice should never be left out at room temperature longer than two hours.</li>
        </ul>

<p>Short grain white rice is often covered with a starch that you can rinse off if you don't want your rice to be too sticky.</p>

<h1>How to Cook Short Grain Rice</h1>
    <li>To wash away excess starch, measure rice into a pot and pour in enough cold water to cover the grains. Gently swish the rice with your fingers and rub lightly. Pour out the starchy water (you can pour through a sieve so you don't lose any grains). Repeat one or two times, depending on how starchy the rice is. The water does not have to be completely clear after the final wash.</li>
    
    <li>Cover the pot and bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to its lowest setting. Let the rice gently simmer for 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
    
    <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let the rice continue to steam in the covered pot for five minutes. </li>
